[[/Tools/Census]] -- Census data access

Syntax: gridlabd census COUNTRY STATE [COUNTY]

The census tool obtains Census Bureau data about counties

Data obtained include the following:

* `state`: state FIPS code

* `county`: county FIPS code

* `gcode`: NREL county $g$-code

* `pgode`: HIFLD county $p$-code

* `tzspec`: timezone specification for state and county

* `population_{year}`: population for the indicated year

Caveats:

The value of `STATE` must be the two character abbreviation, e.g., `CA`.  The
value `COUNTY` may be a county name or a `regex` pattern to match multiple
counties.  The defaults value for `COUNTY` is `.*`, which will match all
counties in the state.

Some counties have multiple timezones. The `tzspec` specification for counties
that have more than one timezone is given for the more populous/larger portion of
the county. The following counties are affected by this issue:

* Florida: Gulf
* Idaho: Idaho
* Nebraska: Cherry
* North Dakota: McKenzie, Dunn, Sioux
* Oregon: Malheur
* South Dakota: Cherry
