# Description

Shunt objects are used to manage the voltage of its `parent` bus. A shunt device
can be a capacitor or synchronous condense, depending on the values of the properties describing the device. 

Shunt devices' `control_mode` is either `FIXED`, `DISCRETE_V` for capacitor, or
`CONTINOUS_V` for synchronous condenser. Shunts are controlled by monitoring
voltage magnitude on the `parent` bus (or the remote bus if `remote_bus` is
specified). For example, capacitors are controlled over the ranges of
`steps_1` if non-zero, with each step incrementing the capacitor by
`admittance_1` MW, allowing `admittance` to have values from 0 to
`step_1*admittance_1`, inclusive. Synchronous condensers have a `step_1` of
zero, and the `admittance` can have continuous values from `-admittance_1` to
`+admittance_1`, inclusive.

The `minimum_voltage_deadband` specifies the minimum separation between the
`voltage_low` and `voltage_high` that will result in an error.

The following table is a guide to some typical shunt device properties

| Device    | Property       | Value            | Remarks
| ----------| -------------- | ---------------- | -------
| Capacitor | `control_mode` | `DISCRETE_V`     | control from `0` to `step_1 x admittance_1`
|           | `input`        | `MAGNITUDE`      | measure voltage magnitude
|           | `output`       | `REACTIVE`       | convert real power to reactive power
|           | `voltage_low`  | e.g., `0.95`     | voltage below which to add reactive power
|           | `voltage_high` | e.g., `1.05`     | voltage above which to reduce reactive power
|           | `step_1`       | e.g., `10`       | number of discrete control steps
|           | `admittance_1` | e.g., `0.1 MW`   | susceptance change per control step
| Condenser | `control_mode` | `CONTINUOUS_V`   | control from `-admittance_1` to `+admittance_1`
|           | `input`        | `MAGNITUDE`      | measure voltage magnitude
|           | `output`       | `REACTIVE`       | convert real power to reactive power
|           | `voltage_low`  | e.g., `0.95`     | voltage below which to add reactive power
|           | `voltage_high` | e.g., `1.05`     | voltage above which to reduce reactive power
|           | `admittance_1` | e.g., `1 MW`     | output limit (positive value for both max and min)
|           | `control_gain` | e.g., 10 MW/pu.V | control feedback gain

# Properties

The following properties determine how a `shunt` device operates.

## `enumeration control_mode`

Determines the shunt device control mode.

### `FIXED`

The shunt device is fixed and does not change the shunt admittance of the
parent bus.

### `DISCRETE_V`

The shunt device `admittance` varies the admittance `Gs` or susceptance `Bs`
of the `parent` bus according to the value of `output` in response to the
voltage inputs of the `remote_bus`, if specified. If the `remote_bus`
is not specified then the `parent` bus is used as the control input.

### `CONTINOUS_V`

The shunt device `admittance` varies the admittance `Gs` or susceptance `Bs`
of the `parent` bus according to the value of `output` in response to the
voltage inputs of the `remote_bus`, if specified. If the `remote_bus`
is not specified then the `parent` bus is used as the control input.

## `enumeration status`

Shunt device status.

### `ONLINE`

The shunt device is active and will change the admittance of the `parent`
bus.

### `OFFLINE`

The shunt device is inactive and will not change the admittance of the
`parent` bus.

## `input`

The `input` properties determine whether the input voltage is the angle or magnitude measured at the bus.

### `ANGLE`

The input voltage angle is measured and compared to `voltage_high` and `voltage_low`.

### `MAGNITUDE`

The input voltage magnitude is measured and compared to `voltage_high` and `voltage_low`.

## `output`

### `REAL`

The output consumed real power at the bus.

### `REACTIVE`

The output converts real power to reactive power at the bus.

## `double voltage_high[pu]`

The upper voltage limit at which the shunt device's voltage lowering strategy
will be engaged.

## `double voltage_low[pu]`

The lower voltage limit at which the shunt device's voltage raising strategy
will be engaged.

## `object remote_bus`

The name of the remote bus from which voltage input is measured. If not
specified, the `parent` bus is used as the voltage input.

## `double admittance[MVAr]`

The shunt admittance used when the shunt device is engaged, specified at unity
voltage.

## `int32 steps_1`

The number of admittance steps in control block 1.

## `double admittance_1[MVAr]`

The admittance step of control block 1, specified at unity voltage.

## `dwell_time[s]`

The control lockout time before another control can be taken.

# Examples

on a test swing bus in `pypower`.
